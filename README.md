## Description
   An application for readers to read, checkout, return, and connect digital books online

## Usage
     BookBook is an online community created to allow readers who have the same reading interests and live nearby to connect and share books. 

## Installation 
Initially we ran a npm install and made sure all team members added the .env file to local drive.  
The front-end team applied the Ulkit framework to html and css. We also used avascript to search for books. 

The back-end team used the Google Books API and npm package. This allowed the team to make a back-end version of the Google Books API.  dotenv was used to enable environmental variables in order to protect the API key. They also used two languages, javascript and jquery, to get things running on the back-end. MySQL was used to handle the books’ data. 

The back-end team also used Bcrypt, Passport, Passport.js – local strategy and Express.  Bcrypt is a npm dependency that was used to store user’s passwords safely in our database for this project. Passport is an authentication middleware system widely used to create authentication process to access a restricted route. We used the Local Strategy version of passport.js which uses email and password authentication. The we way used it in our project was at the “/login” route. Express session works in conjunction of passport.js to track the user in a “session” using cookies.
